# 1.1 Hierarchical permissions from site collection

## summary

Verify that inherited permissions are populated all the way from site collection through all the individual items.

This also verifies that list item attachments have their permissions associated with the list item that contains them. 

## steps

* create ldap users usr1, usr2, usr3, usr4
* create a site collection sc1
* create a sharepoint group sc1_sg1 on site collection sc1
* assign usr1 to sc1_sg1
* create an ldap group lg1
* assign usr2 to ldap group lg1
* set site collection sc1 with role assignments:

	assigned to a sharepoint group sc1_sg1
	assigned to a sharepoint user usr3
	assigned to an ldap group lg1

* create a site s1 within sc1 with no unique role assignments
* create a list l1_sc1 within sc1 with no unique role assignments
* create a list l2_s1 within s1 with no unique role assignments
* create a list item li1_l1_sc1 within l1_sc1 with no unique role assignments
* create a list item li2_l2_s1 within l2_s1 with no unique role assignments
* create a list item attachment a1_li1_l1_sc1 within li1_l1_sc1
* create a list item attachment a2_li2_l2_s1 within li2_l2_s1

crawl sc1

## assertions:

verify usr1, usr2 and usr3 can see every object that you crawled from sc1.

verify usr4 can *not* see any object you crawled from sc1.
