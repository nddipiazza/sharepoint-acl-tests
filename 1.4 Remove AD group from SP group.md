# 1.4 Remove AD group from SP group

## summary

Verify updates to inherited AD groups within Sharepoint groups are updated in the search collection.

## steps

* create ldap users `usr1_4_1`, `usr1_4_2`
* create a site collection `sc1_4`
* create a sharepoint group `sc1_4_sg1` on site collection `sc1_4`
* assign `usr1_4_1` to `sc1_4_sg1`
* create an ldap group `lg1_4`
* assign `usr1_4_2` to ldap group `lg1_4`
* set site collection `sc1_4` with role assignments:
  * `sc1_4_sg1`
  * `lg1_4`
* create a site `s1_4` within `sc1_4` (leave the inherited role assignments)
* create a list `l1_4` within `sc1_4` (leave the inherited role assignments)
* crawl `sc1_4`

## assertions 1:

verify `usr1_4_1` and `usr1_4_2` can see every object that you crawled from sc1.

## steps 2

* Remove ldap group `lg1_4` from `sc1_4` 
* re-crawl

## assertions2:

verify `usr1_4_2` can no longer see any object that you crawled from `sc1_4`.
